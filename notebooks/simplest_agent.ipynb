      "- Ripeness matters: greener bananas have more resistant starch (great for slower sugar release), riper bananas have more sugar but tastier and sweeter.\n",
      "- Watch the downsides: if you have kidney issues, monitor potassium; watch portions if you’re tracking sugars; give toddlers a small piece to avoid choking.\n",
      "- Quick tips: blend into smoothies, slice on oats, or pair with peanut butter for lasting energy.\n",
